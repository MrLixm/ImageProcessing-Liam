# lxMath

Mathematical components for image processing. This includes 
matrices, vectors, ...

Based on [ASWF Imath](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/Imath) with
try at having a similar API but not strictly identical.

This is a work-in-progress based on my current needs with no
goal as making this very usable.
